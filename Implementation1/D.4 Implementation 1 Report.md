# Tests

# Adopted Technologies

The technologies used for this project were:

* **Android Studio IDE:** The best possible option for Android application development. The IDE uses Java and C/C++ and includes many tools, libraries, and features to provide the best possible mobile application development experience. 

* **Android Studio UI Developer:** One of the many tools available in Android Studio. It allows realtime displays of the user interface during development, allowing the developer to make changes on the fly while observing their changes in realtime. It also has many sliders and options to set for the user interface. 

* **Android Studio Device Emulator:** Another tool in Android Studio, allowing developers to run an emulated Android device to run the application and test all functionality and features from the computer. 

# Learning/Training

The team spent time both together and separately researching the best options for technologies. Once we all agreed on the IDE, UI designer, and other technologies, we spent time watching videos, reading articles, and experimenting with them to learn them as best as possible. This included some of the cited sources that we linked in the Readme. 

# Deployment

# Licensing

For the licensing, we chose the GNU GPLv3 license. This was because it allowed some freedom for people to use our project as they like, while protecting our closed source code files. This means that we can provide the community code while protecting what makes our product unique and valuable. We have added the LICENSE file to the main directory to reflect this choice.
