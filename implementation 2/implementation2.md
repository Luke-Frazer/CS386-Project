## 5. Code Quality ##

Our team focused on using Github to keep each other accountable for all pushes. Each time a project was modified and pushed to github, others would review the code and make comments on how to improve it if needed. Once the push was verified to be clean, cohesive, and efficient, it would be pushed to the main branch. Additionally, much of the group met together to either discuss how to implement certain features or to work on coding together in order to make sure all parts would fit together well. In the end, we were able to piece each individual developers code into one coherent package. 

## 6. Lessons Learned ##

We learned a few things while working on this iteration of the project. For one, it is difficult to use Amazon Web Services (AWS) for implementing client-server communication when one of our developers was previously banned from using AWS indefinetely... However, we were able to get around this by having another developer implement that section instead. We also learned that it is better to focus on finalizing one small part of code until it works perfectly than it is to try and implement multiple features at once. We managed to do this rather well by first making sure the portfolio worked, then the calendar, then the login, then we pieced it all into one package. If we were to change one thing, it would have been to create a robust settings tab that could allow the user to adjust things such as how often they get notified, what type of notifications, what stores they prefer, etc.
