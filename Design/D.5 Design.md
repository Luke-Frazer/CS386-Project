### Description ###

**Use Case:** Looking for closest store

**Actor:** User

**Description:** The user searches for what store has their item, looking for the closest available store with it.

**Pre-Conditions:** The user has an account. The user has said what unit of measurement to use.

**Post-Conditions:** The user has found what stores carry the given item, and knows which is closest.

**Main Flow:**
 * The user searches their item in the search bar.
 * The user can sort from a variety of options, including distance.
 * The user can click on the item to ‘favorite’ it.

**Alternative Flows:**
 * Users can access the items through the “Saved Items”, “Seasonal Items”, or “Deals & Coupons” tab rather than the search bar.
 * User can sort using different options from distance.
