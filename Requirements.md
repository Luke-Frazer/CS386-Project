## 5. MVP
Many young adults tend to forget little items when going to the grocery store. MyGroceryAssistant can help relieve some of these small yet annoying issues. The main features of the app include a calendar that keeps track of what items you should buy and on what day. This feature will then add all grocery items into a list once the certain date is reached, keeping track of all the items that you may want to go out and re-buy. The second main feature of the app is the reminder function. This part of the app will give you weekly reminders of what items you may need for the upcoming week. We can test these features by providing the app different groups of grocery shoppers making sure the app responds with a unique and beneficial response.

## 6. Use Cases
A use case would be “recommend items” and our actor would be Admin. This use case is only available to admin and it’s there to make a list of items that all shoppers on the app can see.
